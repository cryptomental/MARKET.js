[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/MARKETProtocol/MARKET.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MARKETProtocol/MARKET.js) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/MARKETProtocol/MARKET.js/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/MARKETProtocol/MARKET.js?branch=master)

MARKET Protocol has been created to provide a secure, flexible, open source foundation for decentralized trading on the Ethereum blockchain. We provide the pieces necessary to create a decentralized exchange, including the requisite clearing and collateral pool infrastructure, enabling third parties to build applications for trading.

# MARKET.js

Take a look at our [docs](https://docs.marketprotocol.io) for a little more explanation.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/MARKET.js
$ YOURFOLDERNAME
$ cd YOURFOLDERNAME
$ npm install
```

A Makefile is provided for easy setup of the local development environment.

Some pre-requisites are required in order to utilize the Makefile.

NodeJS 8.11.2 LTS is recommended for compatibility.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:MARKETProtocol/MARKET.js.git  # clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MARKETProtocol/ethereum-bridge.git # and the needed oraclize.it bridge (for local test rpc)
```

From here you will be able to use make commands assuming npm is already installed.

Assuming you have npm already, Install truffle
```
$ make install_truffle # may require sudo
```

Install needed dependencies.  If this fails on your ubuntu install it may require you to run `sudo apt-get install build-essential -y` prior to installing.
```
$ make install_deps
```

You can start the truffle development environment and console
```
$ make start_console
```

From here, in a separate console, we now need to bring up the ethereum bridge for the Oraclize.it service.
```
$ make start_bridge
```

Once the bridge has fully initialized, you should be able to run the example migrations for the MARKET Protocol smart contracts.
```
truffle(develop)> migrate
```
If this fails due to a `revert`, please be sure the bridge is listening prior to attempting the migration.

A local blockchain is now running with a fully deployed suite of MARKET Protocol smart contracts.
The needed `json` ABI files can now be found in `./build/contracts/`

## Testing

In order for the tests to work, you will need to have followed the above steps to ensure truffle is running, `ethereum-bridge` is running, and the migrations have deployed our contracts.

If all of this is set up correctly, the below should work.

```shell
$ npm run test
```

## Using Docker

It is possible to build and execute tests in the same way as in Travis CI by using Docker orchestration.

Prerequisites: docker and docker-compose installed.

### Running tests

#### Import environment variables

```
set -a
source .env
```

#### Start containers

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The first run will take a while since images will be pulled from Docker registry. After that images are cached and the start will be much faster.


#### Install dependencies

```
docker-compose exec marketjs npm install
docker-compose exec eth-bridge scripts/wait_for_oraclize_connector.sh
```

#### Build

```
docker-compose exec marketjs truffle migrate
docker-compose exec marketjs npm run build
```

#### Start tests

```
docker-compose exec marketjs env TRUFFLE_DEVELOP_HOST="$TRUFFLE_DEVELOP_HOST" npm run test:prod
```


## Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the library modules generated by this project:

```javascript
import { Contract, Collateral, Order, Settlement } from './marketjs'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import { something } from 'marketjs/dist/lib/something'
```

## NPM scripts

 - `npm run test`: Run test suite
 - `npm run start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
 - `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
 - `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)
